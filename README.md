MPOS - mini python operation system

It is just some comands it can answer.
Nothing but a simple python project, I made for fun.

In the keywords.json file, are all the keywords it can answer.
In authentification directory are all files for authentification, include json databases.
In keywords directory are all keywords, wich code is longer then one line.
In ./keywords/keywordRequest.py are all keywords that are one line long.

just run main.py, and it gonna work. I hope.
